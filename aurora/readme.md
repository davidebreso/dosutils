## What

This is a modified executable for the Aurora v3.0c editor for 8086 DOS.
The patch removes some 386 instructions that are present in the original version, and causes problems on lesser machines, most notably when scrolling the screen horizontally.

## How

To apply the patch, download download the [8086 fully-functional Aurora 3.0](http://www.oldskool.org/guides/texteditors/#downloads) from Trixter's page [Text Editors for the 8088](http://www.oldskool.org/guides/texteditors/), and then replace `a.exe` with the executable on this repository.
