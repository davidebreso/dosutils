------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMITSRS
	list currently-installed TSRs using the alternate multiplex interrupt

Usage:	AMITSRS
		list manufacturer, name, and description of each TSR

	AMITSRS <anything>
		verbose listing; adds a second line with TSR version
		and private entry point (if any), a third line
		detailing the number of hotkeys and how checked, and
		additional lines listing the hotkeys (if any).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FASTMOUS
	convert slow (on some systems) mouse hardware reset call into
	mouse software reset call.

Usage:	FASTMOUS
		install FASTMOUS

	FASTMOUS R
		remove FASTMOUS from memory

Resident Size: 128 bytes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOLPT
	turn a parallel port into a bit bucket by making it appear to
	always be ready for output and ignoring any output calls.

Usage:	NOLPT n
		install NOLPT on LPTn

	NOLPT nU
		remove (uninstall) NOLPT from LPTn

Resident Size: 192/240 bytes (high/low)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE
	popup one-line note taker

Usage:	NOTE -Ifile
		install NOTE, using <file> as the notepad

	NOTE -R
		remove NOTE from memory

Note:	NOTE keeps the notepad file open as long as it remains
	resident, in order to reduce the size of the resident code and
	data.  The file is open in write-only deny-none mode, which
	allows other programs using the correct sharing modes (such as
	LIST.COM and 4DOS) to access the notepad.  Unfortunately,
	COMMAND.COM does *NOT* use any sharing modes, even in version
	6.22--three major releases after sharing modes were introduced!
	Thus you will get a sharing violation if you attempt to TYPE
	or COPY the notepad using COMMAND.COM while NOTE is loaded.

Resident Size: 2160/2224 bytes (high/low with generic hotkey handler)
	       2080/2144 bytes (high/low with custom hotkey handler)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

POPUP
	request that a specified TSR pop itself up if it supports that
	operation

Usage:	POPUP <tsrname>

	POPUP <manufacturer> <tsrname>

Note:	both <manufacturer> and <tsrname> may be abbreviated; if more
	than one TSR matches, the matching TSRs will be listed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RBKEYSWP
	swap Esc and tilde/backquote keys as well as LeftControl and
	CapsLock keys

Usage:	RBKEYSWP I
		install in memory

	RBKEYSWP R
		remove from memory

------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMOVE
	remove one or more TSRs from memory

Usage:	REMOVE *

	REMOVE <tsrname>

	REMOVE <manufacturer> <tsrname>

Note:	both <manufacturer> and <tsrname> may be abbreviated; if more
	than one TSR matches, you will be prompted whether to remove
	all matching TSRs.  REMOVE * removes all AMIS-compliant TSRs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SWITCHAR
	provide switch-character support which was removed from MSDOS 5.0

Usage:	SWITCHAR I
		install

	SWITCHAR R
		remove from memory

	SWITCHAR D
		disable switchar calls

	SWITCHAR E
		enable switchar calls

	SWITCHAR <x>
		set switch character to <x>

Resident Size: 224/288 bytes (high/low)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

VGABLANK
	VGA-specific screen blanker
