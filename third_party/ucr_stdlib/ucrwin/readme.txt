The UCRWin project was created by several students at UCR.
It provides an object-oriented windowing system for 80x86
assembly language programmers.
The current status of this project is "barely working but
stalled" (since the original members have long since
graduated).  Use this code at your own discretion.
If you can figure it out, have fun.
